  <p> Hello. My name is Eamon Lightning. I am a senior in the Sound Recording Technology program at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, where I am also minoring in Computer Science. </p>
  <p> I have almost no web development experience (as is likely apparent), however, I intend to change that over the course of this semester and gain some valuable insight into how the design of a user interface can be optimized to improve user experience. </p>
